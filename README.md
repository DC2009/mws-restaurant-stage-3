#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Stage 3

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, I implemented the following requirements:
- a form for adding reviews
- a favorite button on the main page for each restaurant
- improved performance by loading the map on request
- usage of idb for local data storage

The server for stage 3 runs on localhost:1337

To install the projects run:

npm install

and

gulp build

then 

gulp 

if you want the page to be served from localhost:5000
